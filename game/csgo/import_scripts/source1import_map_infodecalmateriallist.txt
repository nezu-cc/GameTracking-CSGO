// list of material names used by infodecal entities that need fixing up by hand since a version of the material exists with projection
// and infodecal entites are converted to info_overlay entites, that do not use projection. 
// We add _decalinfo to the material name (e.g. wood1 becomes wood1_infodecal).
// These materials need to be added to content\csgo by hand
